**Coming Soon!**<br>
At this time our bot is not publicly available, but you can follow our bot's program account to see some activity at:<br>https://solscan.io/account/BqirtYFXWbEaQr2VxcDKZ7nehZqNtqrLJbpoUaBpPZ6z

Our bot is currently being run on a Mac laptop alongside a self-hosted Jupiter using Quasar RPC.

Be sure to check back here frequently for updates, we're close to an alpha release! We have a Discord that's still being worked on but feel free to join<br>https://discord.gg/76JgyMmt

**Standalone Java Run Example**<br>
java -cp NotArbBot-[version].jar ABSOLUTE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH



~~ WIP ~~

**Warning:** Do not use any NotArb files that you did not directly download from our official GitHub page.

**How it works**<br>
NotArb Bot is a Solana bot that utilizes Jupiter Swap to find and execute arbitrage transactions as quickly as possible.

**What you will need**<br>
RPC Server<br>
Jupiter Server<br>
Bot Server<br>
<br>
The bot itself doesn't require such a heavy hitting host like the RPC and Jupiter server do. Recommended specs to come.

Also, you could technically run the bot using free rpc endpoints, you'll just have very poor land rate. The better your servers the better your returns.

More info to come!
